+ **Multi-source Database Management System**. 

  This is a database course project which was written at Nov 2019

  Techniques: `Python, PostgreSQL and Shell Script.`

+ The **CardGameRLEnv** Directory is an implmentation on a smaller card game, which also includes some classical methods.

  Techniques: `Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Neural Networks, Bayes Inference, Tensorflow(Keras), Pandas, Data Pipeline Building, Shell Script`,

  The card game reinforcement framework which is an extension of state-of-the-art AlphaGoZero which is designed by Google. The new framework was designed by Qiqi Jiang and Kuangzheng Li(2019). The paper was pulished on IJCAI 2019.

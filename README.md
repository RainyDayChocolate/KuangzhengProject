## **MultiSourceDataEDAPlatform**. 

+ This is a database course project which was written at Nov 2019

+ Techniques: `Python, PostgreSQL and Shell Script.`

## CardGameRLEnv
+ The **CardGameRLEnv** Directory is an implmentation on a less complicated card game compared with DDZ. Several classical algorithms such as PIMC, ISMCTS are also included.

+ Techniques: `Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Neural Networks, Bayes Inference, Tensorflow(Keras), Pandas, Data Pipeline Building, Shell Script`

+ The card game reinforcement framework which is an extension of state-of-the-art AlphaGoZero which is designed by Google. The new framework was designed by Qiqi Jiang and Kuangzheng Li(2019). The paper was pulished on IJCAI 2019. 

+ Paper Link is https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2019/0176.pdf

## WordGameRL
+ The **WordGameRL** Directory is contains an algorithm for improving AI's communication with human. It includes implementations of  Actor Critic, Q-Learning and Policy Gradient  with deep-reinforcement Learning.

+ Techniques: `Natural Language Processing, BERT, Reinforcement Learning, Tensorflow`
